      <description>Capturing information As a modern birder, good photos are central. Proof of identification is the difference between ecstacy and catastrophe. I recently got a new phone and I&amp;rsquo;m curious about its capabilities of taking good photos, both in terms of being able to capture useful information on a pixel level, but also in terms of taking aesthetic photos of birds and their surroundings.&#xA;Some notes on editing All photos are shot in RAW format and are afterwards (subjectively) edited to look good.</description>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:&#xA;You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc. There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
