As a birder, getting good photos consistently is really important. I recently got a new phone and I'm curious about its capabilities, both in terms of being able to capture detailed information down to a pixel level, but also in terms of the photos being aesthetically pleasing. Below, I will compare photos taken with the phone with photos taken with a proper camera setup. 

# Some notes on editing

I prefer to shoot in RAW for flexibility of exposure, color balance, noise reduction, and sharpening. I especially want avoid locking in noise reduction and sharpening which often result in ugly digital artefacts. However, comparing unedited RAW files from different cameras and brands can be misrepresentative since photo editing programs may not necessarily interpret (and display) the encoded data from different RAW formats in the same way. As of now, I have edited the phone pictures to look good on my phone, and then edited the camera photos to match them as closely as possible. 

# Sony Xperia 5V with Kowa TSN-883 *vs* Nikon DSLR  

Comparing the digiscoping setup to a wild-life camera setup; a Nikon D500 + 300mm AF-S F/4 + TC-II Teleconverter.

The Xperia picture appears clearer, less smudgy, and has more of a 3D feeling than the Nikon D500 picture. I also find the digiscoped picture to have a calmer appearance and my eyes aren't as confused about what they're seeing. 

Here is a side-by-side.

Below is a comparison of some starlings.

Given that the starling in focus on the first picture left the rock, and the one behind is out of focus, let's compare more stable areas of the picture, like those in the red areas on the shots above.

Below are two comparison photos. The first shows the Sony Xperia shot downscaled to match the Nikon's resolution, and the second shows the Nikon shot upscaled to match the Sony Xperia's resolution.

To me, it's clear that the digiscoping setup with the Sony Xperia results in pictures with better 'pixel control.' In both comparisons, the Sony pictures are sharper, have more depth, and fewer artifacts. The blades of grass appear smoother and sharper. The Sony shots seem to have a higher density of information of the real world.

As for the aesthetics, the Sony seems to have potential.
